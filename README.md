# Traveler_Guide-Can-Run-both-on-IOS-Android-

## Problem Definition
In today’s world, mobile devices are becoming very intelligent and many travelers have started using their mobile devices to explore the places around them. These travelers either use a travel guide application or take assistance from a tourist guide to explore the new city. There are many applications available for travelers in the market to find cheap hotels, car rentals and best dining places at the new city. But only very few applications like Sidekix offers route planner to help the travelers find the best way to get anywhere around the city without the help of a tourist guide. Also, the existing application does not consider about the user’s likes and dislikes and their availability during a day. Our mobile application as the name implies smartly examines user’s likes and the time duration the user is expected to explore a new city/place. The proposed system provides an astonishing result in the form of 2 best route to explore the city. The user is asked to fill some questionnaire when the user logs in the system. The questionnaires include questions like the user liking, start time, duration and place the user wants to explore. The proposed application smartly scans for the place based on user-specified information and helps the user to discover the places adjacent to them or throughout the world. The application displays a map with detailed description about a particular place. This application significantly minimizes the time needed by the travelers to search for a place. 
## Motivation
The main motivation behind developing this system was to serve the purpose of a travel guide. There are many applications in the market that are working to serve the purpose of a travel guide but only a few consider users likings and their availability to search the popular places. The smart city traveler app retrieves the popular travel places by considering user likes and time preferences. Most of the applications in the market provide the route to the user while does not consider the likes and time duration for the user. Our main motivation was to allow the user to search popular places keeping in mind the time duration the user have to explore a new place. The purpose was to replace traditional traveler guide applications that only displays all the places without considering the user likes or dislikes. This application was made keeping in mind the likes of the user.
